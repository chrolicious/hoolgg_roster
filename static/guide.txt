Special thanks to Post Nerf Clarity and Reloe of Northern Sky for their contributions!

Feb 13 Update - Important!

I’ve been wanting to update the guide with more accurate information as the weeks have passed since my first publication. However, with less than 2 weeks until Early Access starts, we still have no official information from any member of Blizzard in regards to the updated rewards systems. Due to that, I’m going to be updating the guide for my best guess to the content we will have available and my best guess for the crafting costs. For those counting, we do not have official information on

    Any of the crest changes. Upgrade costs, crafting costs, weekly crest change
    What content will be available in Early Access, including crests, delves, dungeons, prey etc.
    What content will be available in the pre-season weeks, including crests, delves, heroic and mythic dungeons, what versions of prey will be available, etc.
    Spark and catalyst timelines for Season 1 - items cost 2/4 sparks, do we still get a bonus spark, etc
    Is there a raid renown this season? If not, how will balance be handled going forward
    Is there a turbo boost this season? If so, are we going to be expected to do 70+ +12’s to crest cap that week?

Because of this, I am doing my best guesses. I will update the information when pre-release starts or if we get any Blizzard communication.

I have made a checklist that follows the guide below. If you’d like to use it, you can find it here. Dev from Refined has created an addon that automatically updates whenever I update the checklist!

My guild has also made a Loot Helper spreadsheet like last season if you’d like to share it with your guild leader or loot council.

If you want to buy me a coffee, you can do so here. Thank you for all your support over the years!

What’s changed for Raiders in Midnight?

If you don’t care about any of this, you can skip to here or use the sheet.

Blizzard has harkened back to the days of Mists and Cata where we are getting a tier split amongst multiple raids with a slightly staggered release date including a heroic week. Week 1 of Season 1 will have mythic 0 dungeons and include LFR, Normal, and Heroic difficulties of the 6 boss Voidspire raid and the 1 boss Dreamrift raid. Week 2 will include the mythic versions of these raids and unlock M+ as well. Week 3 will unlock the LFR, Normal, Heroic, and Mythic versions of the 2 boss raid March on Quel’danas, which will contain the Omni-Token and the two hardest bosses of the season. There are some advantages to this - split raid IDs opens the possibility for not having to extend earlier in the season if you still want to reclear. If you’re working on the 6th boss of Voidspire, you can still clear Dreamrift quickly. If you’re working on March of Quel’danas, you could quickly clear the first 3 bosses of Voidspire and the Dreamrift to get 2 raid vault slots each week while still working on the March bosses. For the truly degenerate amongst you, you could even try to do mythic Dreamrift splits because it won’t affect the lockout of Voidspire or March. I look forward to seeing what y’all cook up!

Next, the changes to gearing in Midnight.

    Crests are now track-specific. Hero track items require heroic crests only, mythic track items require mythic crests only etc. That means you can upgrade hero items to 5/6 and 6/6 and theoretically not sabotage your mythic progression (more on that later).
    They removed valorstones! YAY! They made it cost a miniscule amount of gold instead for some asinine reason! Less YAY!
    The champion track (normal raid difficulty) is reduced to a 6 rank track. Items at 6/6 champion are the equivalent of 2/6 hero, making normal mode trinkets, tier, etc. weaker than they currently are.
    Upgrade costs now increase with each step. Going from 1/6 to 2/6 is 10 crests, 2/6 to 3/6 is 20 crests, 3/6 to 4/6 is 30 crests etc. This changes upgrading an item from requiring 75 crests to 150.
    The crest cap is raised from 90 to 100, but the upgrade changes significantly slow full gearing and increase the amount of work you’ll need to do each week to make sure you don’t waste crests.
    Finally, one handed weapons suck and non-crafted 2h weapons suck. More on that below.

One good change from the crest system is that Hero crests are no longer worthless. This can seem frustrating to some - who wants to be thinking about Hero crests 8 weeks into a tier? - but it’s actually a slight increase in player power. Go back to your week 5 logs and see how many 4/6 Hero track pieces you have equipped. With the new upgrade system, you can continue to upgrade these with Hero crests and gain small amounts of power each week. While I don’t think this offsets the negatives of the new upgrade system, it is a small boon.

A small change with tier tokens. Tier tokens are now sorted by armor type. Tier tokens from The Dreamrift have the prefix “aln-” and Tier tokens from The Voidspire have the prefix “void-”. Plate wearers use the Alnforged and Voidforged tokens, Mail wearers use the Alncast and Voidcast tokens, Leather wearers uses the Alncured and Voidcured tokens, and Cloth wearers use the Alnwoven and Voidwoven tokens. Be aware that the Omnitoken will not become available until the 3rd week.

Another nice change is that once you acquire your 4-set bonus for the first time, all content can drop catalyst charges going forward. This makes queueing for LFR to try to get tier pieces so that you can activate your 4set bonus ASAP very important. Once unlocked, you can catalyze that higher item level non-set piece from M+ easily and still guarantee the ability to catalyze the random mythic armor piece you get from your vault.

There is a new system called Prey that shares the reward of 1 heroic item per week with Delve, meaning you can pick between Prey or Delves to get your 1 heroic item per week. However, when it comes to repeatable stuff, it’s likely Delves will be a better choice for farming Myth crests and other items later in the season. I highly recommend keeping up with Moleman’s Delve Compendium if you are interested in Delves and their various rewards.  

There are a wide variety of consumables following in the same track as Dragonflight and TWW. You have your typical primary, secondary, and tertiary enchants. The only new twists are a crit damage ring enchant and an embellishment that doubles the strength of the special crafted Jewelcrafting rings and amulets. There are the normal sharpening stones by Blacksmiths but there’s also a new enchanting stone that gives melee attacks an arcane damage proc. While these are interesting, we all know we’re just going to do what sims tell us to do :( Food buffs return as highest secondary and primary stat but also increase your stamina as well, providing some extra survivability for those early weeks. You can still combine 10 feasts or 5 food buffs to make them hearty.

Updated 2/18: There are a wide variety of new renowns that award Champion item level pieces at a renown level very easily reached after the campaign, especially with the DMF 10% buff for side quests. The Renown reward items are head, waist, necklace, and trinket. These provide a small but tangible power boost leading into the first Heroic raid. Praise be, Neryssa now has a guide on Icy-Veins!

What are the ramifications of the new upgrade system?

Weapons are a terrible option from raid drops and vault. With the old upgrade system, picking a weapon from the vault was excellent because it let you craft in other slots and let you fully upgrade the weapon to 6/6. This made sense when crest costs were linear - 15 per upgrade. You’d obviously prefer upgrading a weapon to gloves. Now, however, that final +4 ilvl upgrade costs 50 crests and you lose the typically stronger weapon embellishment. Casters don’t even want to do MH+OH - you’re spending 200 precious Mythic crests to get your weapon slot to the same power as spending 60 Mythic crests. Crests, especially with the new upgrade system, are simply much more important than the 2 sparks saved.

Crafting is unbelievably overpowered with the new Crest Economy. Before, crafting an item cost 60 crests to craft an item at 5/6 upgrade track, which was 66% of your weekly crests and matched the cost of just upgrading a 1/6 item to 5/6. Now, crafting an item costs 60 crests to craft an item at 5/6 upgrade track, which is 60% of your weekly crests and 60% of the cost it would take to upgrade an item from 1/6 to 5/6. This greatly incentivizes you to not upgrade any slot that you would craft on.

By setting up the system this way, Blizzard is directly incentivizing players to sandbag their gear to gain power later: You’re not going to spend Heroic crests until after you are done with reclear on week 3 and after week 4 when you’re finally at 4/6 hero track or better in every slot, you have some weird choices to make. Which pieces do you upgrade each week? You can only upgrade from 4/6-5/6 twice a week and every time you low roll and upgrade a slot that you get a Mythic track from raid or vault that week you gain less power than others who get that item in a different slot. Over the course of the 8 weeks it takes to have every item at the ilvl equivalent of 6/6 hero, there’s a high risk for power loss due to item replacement. Obvious choices are going to be 1x ring, or an offhand weapon, stuff like that, but eventually you’re just going to be straight up gambling and praying.

Early mythic progression vault breakpoints are very powerful. Every item in your vault you claim at 3/6 or 4/6 is going to be a significant ilvl increase over other people. Unless they change M+ vault to having scaling ilvl drops, taking an item from your m+ track is going to feel very bad compared to taking it from your raid vault. Taking a 3/6 from your vault is the equivalent of getting 30% more Crests per week - taking a 4/6 is 60% more Crests per week.

How do I properly upgrade my gear?

Outside of Guilds who clear mythic in less than 4 weeks, spend zero heroic crests until after you are done with reclear on Week 3. Spending Heroic crests before this time is a high risk choice that can significantly hamper your power progression. Because you cannot control which slots you are offered in your vault or what mythic items will drop for your raid and be awarded to you, you have a good chance that any item you upgrade in the first 2 weeks will be replaced by a Mythic piece, wasting the hero crests you spent. Because Hero crests are useful through at least week 8, you don’t want to waste these.

The general rule of thumb when upgrading Heroic pieces is that you want to upgrade every item to 4/6 and then items to 5/6. The exception is heroic trinkets you know you won’t replace until after progression ends because you know those crests won’t be wasted.

When upgrading Mythic pieces, you want to upgrade to 2/6 in every slot and then start to cherry pick where you spend upgrades. Because crafting items only takes 60 Crests to make a 5/6 item and upgrading an item from 1/6 costs 100 Crests, you don’t want to waste crests on slots you know you’re going to be crafting in. However, you don’t want to hold Mythic crests because you don’t want to sabotage your early prog power. I will break it down week by week below.

Why hold crests for “3 weeks”?

I have seen a few players kneejerk reacting to this thinking that I’m recommending they sandbag their team for 3 mythic weeks. It’s important to understand that's not what I am saying. I hope I don't have to add GIFs of subway surfers on each side of this guide!

The first week is normal/heroic only - most CE teams should be able to full clear N/H (even with their splits) without spending upgrades. If you are a team that thinks that you won’t be able to clear without spending crests, you should consider telling your raiders to do so. This advice is clearly not tailored to your guild and that’s okay. Teams WR 1000+ higher may want to spend crests to make these kills easier.

The second week is another full reclear of normal and heroic and then your first mythic progression. If you are a team that is trying to prog pre-nerf Araz or Stix and you need every bit of that DPS, then again, this advice is not tailored to you. You should spend crests because you’re one of less than 30 teams in the world progging these bosses. However, for the teams between WR 30 and WR 1000, you’re going to be stepping in and doing your equivalent of Vex/Cauldron or Plexus/Soulbinder. You shouldn’t need to spend upgrades to kill these bosses. If your guild does happen to hit a wall and wipe at ~1% on a boss, then your raid leader should ask raiders to spend some upgrades. However, again, that’s a small minority of people who read this guide.

Now, everyone else. Week 1 was heroic and maybe splits, week 2 was reclears and maybe splits and a couple mythic bosses. Week 3 is a quick reclear before getting into mythic in earnest. Do your reclear and THEN spend heroic crests, to make sure that the items obtained from vaults, crafting, and reclear don’t waste crests. Then you’re at full strength heading into your first real progression boss - post-nerf araz or stix if you’re in the wr 50-400, or loomithar/rik if you’re in the wr 400-1000 range. This is what’s going to guarantee you the most success for the next couple weeks instead of wasting precious crests the first two weeks on items you replace so that you parse slightly higher on a boss you were already going to kill.

What can I do to prepare for Midnight now?

Spend 30 hours setting up a UI that looks worse than what you had before. Sorry, there really isn’t much to do other than basic get geared, clear your inventory, etc. If you want to do the classic thing, you could save up 20 quests to turn in when the expansion launches but that’s just a PITA.

Icy-veins put together an excellent breakdown of things that are going away when Midnight launches.

I added a list of addons that I recommended for my guild in the FAQ.

-Reclear raid.
-Before mythic progression, spend your heroic crests upgrading as many items from 3/6 266 to 4/6 269. Remember that each upgrade costs 30 crests, letting you upgrade 10 items total. I recommend leaving one ring, trinket, and the slot you know you’re going to craft in 2 weeks unupgraded.

Week 8 - May 5th - done with heroic crests

-Open your vault for a 272+ myth track item.
-Farm +12’s for vault slots and all your various Crests.

-We are going to assume that you have obtained 2 pieces of Mythic loot at 2/6 276 ilvl from the last 2 raid weeks.

-Heroic: Upgrade your last two 5/6 272 items to 6/6 276 for 100 Crests. With an average amount of luck, you are now done with Heroic crests. Some players may finish on week 7, some players on week 9 depending on RNG.

-Upgrade your 1/6 272 myth track item one time, to 2/6 276, for a total of 10 crests.

-Upgrade three 2/6 276 myth tracks one time, to 3/6 279, for a total of 60 crests.

-Upgrade one 3/6 279 myth tracks one time, to 4/6 282, for a total of 30 crests.

-Note: there are small ways to optimize crest usage at this point, keeping some items at 2/6m and upgrading them slowly every 2 weeks with Sparks which is a crest save. This is super min maxy this late in the season and should only be done by players who are confident this is the best choice for their team. At best, I would recommend the average player only do this with bracers/cloak because of the relative weakness of spending crests to upgrade these items manually.

Total Crests spent so far:

780/800 Heroic - done with these

680/700 Gilded


Ending item level:  2x 276h, 3x 279, 7x 282, 3x285(crafted)
Due to randomness of vault and no guarantee for drops, your numbers can mildly fluctuate from this week to week. As long as you follow the general advice, you should be safe.

Weeks 9+ - May 12th on

Your upgrade logic is as follows: craft slots at 5/6m using 60 Crests when you can and get every item to 4/6 282. After that, start upgrading slots to 6/6 289. You’ll probably prefer to upgrade all the way to 6/6 289 due to the +4 jump from 5/6 to 6/6 but you’re going to start simming every single week your crest usage - it’s probable that you’ll want to swap to a 1h + crafted OH at some point, which costs a full week's worth of crests to make that swap. Just keep upgrading and remember that if turbo boost exists as it did in seasons 2/3 of TWW, you’ll be farming 1500 more crests to upgrade items to 7/8 and 8/8. Excited to do 75 +12s 3 months into the season?
